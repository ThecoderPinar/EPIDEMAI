This GitHub repository is prepared to share a data science project. The main purpose of the project is to analyze disease outbreaks using data analysis, visualization, and machine learning methods to predict future outbreaks.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze past data of disease outbreaks to uncover trends and patterns.
- Understand the changes in outbreaks over time through data visualization.
- Predict future outbreaks using epidemiological models.
- Support health decisions with data-driven insights.

## How to Contribute

- Support the project by starring it.
- Review the scope document to learn more about the project details.
- Provide suggestions or feedback in the Issues section.
- Share your own data analysis or modeling ideas.
